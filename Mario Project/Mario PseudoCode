Prompt for a number between 0 and 23 loop around this prompt if the number is out side of the range
Set a temporary variable to height to manipulate
create a loop function that will loop throughout the entire height of the pyramid
in the loop create two for loops that will place the number of spaces (the temp variable minus 1) and number of hashes (number of height minus number of spaces)
these loops should print the necessary items and the main loop will trigger a print new line and take one from the temporary variable that represents the current height that we are on
