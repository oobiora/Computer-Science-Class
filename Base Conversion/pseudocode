1 - get name
2 - get last name
3 - convert names from base 35 to base 10
4 - add names together
5 - convert names from 10 to the base of birthday
6 - repeat 3-5 but multiply instead of add

things needed:
def convertto10():
    multiply place by base ** a number that starts at 0 and goes up by 1
def convertfrom10(x,Y):
    x%Y
    x/Y
    use modulo to get remainder
    use divide to make x smaller
def lookuptable():
    the inputed number is the place of the letter you need
    0-9+A-Z corresponds to each possible letter
def reverselookuptable():
    the letter you need gets you to the number it refers to
    0-9+A-Z corresponds to each possible letter

Program doesnt work
